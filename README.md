CrestronLirc
============

Helpful files for setting up Crestron (or any socket application) to leverage the LIRC functionality inside of Linux

A couple years back I wanted to control Hulu Desktop on my Linux box. After a bit of playing around, I found the right files to modify to simulate it. Hopefully this helps someone else spend a little less time messing around with LIRC. I have put stuff in the extended description to help out.

This project isn't necessarily limited to Crestron (only the .usp file matters), it can be leveraged for any socket application that is written so long as you know what IP/Port to connect to (default is 8765).
